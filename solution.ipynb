    "In this notebook, we will implement a U-Net architecture. Through this exercise you should gain an understanding of the U-Net architecture in particular as well as learn how to approach the implementation of an architecture in general and familiarize yourself a bit more with the inner workings of pytorch.\n",

    "The exercise is split into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 1 you will implement the building blocks of the U-Net. That includes the convolutions, downsampling, upsampling and skip connections. We will go in the order of how difficult they are to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In part 2 you will combine the modules you've built in part 1 to implement the U-Net module and then see how hyperparameters influence its receptive field size.\n",
